# Daily Health Check Skill

Automated daily system health monitoring for Claude Code setups.

## What It Checks

| Component | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Ollama | Running, models loaded, response time |
| MCP Servers | Connected, responding |
| API Keys | Claude, OpenRouter, GitHub, Telegram |
| Disk | Usage % on home drive |
| RAM | Available memory |
| Token Usage | Claude API usage vs quota |
| Agent Registry | sync_agents.py --check |

## Report Location

Results saved to `~/.watchdog/daily_report.json` and logged in `~/.watchdog/daily.log`.

## Auto-Schedule

If cron is set up (via install.sh Phase 11), runs daily at 09:00:
```
0 9 * * * bash ~/.claude/config/daily-check.sh >> ~/.watchdog/daily.log 2>&1
```

## Running Manually

```bash
/daily-check
# or:
bash ~/.claude/config/daily-check.sh
```

## Alerts

If critical issues found (Ollama down, API key expired, disk >90%):
- Sends Telegram notification if bot is running
- Logs to `~/.watchdog/alerts.log`
